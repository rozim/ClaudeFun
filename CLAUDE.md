# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

An experimental Python project for exploring Claude Code. No application code exists yet.

## Expected Tooling

Based on the `.gitignore`, this project anticipates:

- **Package manager:** `uv` (preferred based on gitignore comments) or `pip`
- **Linter/formatter:** `ruff`
- **Type checker:** `mypy`
- **Test runner:** `pytest`
- **Notebooks:** `marimo`

As tools and commands are established, update this file with the actual commands.
